# Real Estate Polygon App

Demo: <https://murmuring-forest-15212.herokuapp.com/>

Click at least twice on the map to create a line, three times or more to create a polygon. On the right are operations you can perform, including a log of the coordinates of the line/polygon and a function that will check a JSON array full of coordinates and return which, if any, are contained inside the polygon (click 'See JSON Data' to see all coordinates).

Specs:
* Create a map program where I can draw polygons in and around Denver
* process real estate data against the map program so I can put each home into its proper polygon (drawn on the map)
* add some custom columns into the DB based on IF/Then statements or calculations
* Ability to export the data
* Future - have a front end interface hit the DB for reporting.
